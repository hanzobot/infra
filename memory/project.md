# Project Memory

High-level goals, non-negotiables, and product intent for BOTCTL.

- Goal: declarative-first, zero manual setup, fully automated host lifecycle.
- Goal: BOTCTLs act as maintainer-grade coding agents.
- Non-negotiable: no secrets in git; explicit secret files only.

Update this when project goals or constraints change.
